# Dark story
### The one that will haunt you for like 5 minutes, but took to long to develop.


### How to run it?
Remember about dependencies!
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you've downloaded all the sound files and that you keep them in `./sounds` directory.

Then run main.py with the working directory exaclty the same as the file:
```bash
python main.py
```
